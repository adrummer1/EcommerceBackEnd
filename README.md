# EcommerceBackEnd

Ecommerce Back End is a server side project for an Ecommerce website that uses the latest technologies to make it competitive with other Ecommerce websites.  

## Technology

The following technologies were employed to make this application functional:

* Express.js API
* MySQL database
* Environment variable to store the database name and MySQL credentials
* Sequalize to connect to the database
* Development database that is seeded with test data
* When the server is started the Sequalize models sync to the MySQL database

When invoked, the application allows the user to GET product, category and tag data (formatted as JSON), as well as create, update, and delete data in the database.
